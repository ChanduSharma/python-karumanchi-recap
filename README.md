# python-karumanchi-recap

A curated collection of coding problems and solutions implemented in Python, based on "Data Structures and Algorithms" style exercises (Karumanchi / similar textbooks). The repository is intended as a study companion and reference for learning algorithmic techniques and common data structures.

## Contents

- **Solutions:** Organized by chapter/topic. Each folder contains one or more Python solution files and optional tests.

## Project structure (recommended)

```
python-karumanchi-recap/
├─ README.md
├─ solutions/                   # solution modules organized by chapter or topic
   ├─ chapter_01_arrays/
   │  ├─ two_sum.py
   │  └─ test_two_sum.py
   └─ chapter_02_linked_lists/
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- (Optional) `virtualenv` or `venv` to isolate dependencies

## Usage

1. Run a single solution or example:

```bash
python solutions/chapter_01_arrays/two_sum.py
```

## Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code style.
- Prefer type hints for public functions where helpful.
